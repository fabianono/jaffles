<h1>Project Jaffles!</h1>

<p>My first data injestion pipeline project from an <a href = "https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop">online repository by DBT</a>( <span style = "font-size:12px">please be nice &#x1F60A;</span>). The original cloned repository can be found under <a href = "https://github.com/fabianono/jaffles/tree/main/deprecated_jaffleshop_dbt">"deprecated_jaffleshop_dbt"</a>.</p>

Here is a snapshot of the data mapping.

<div style = "font-size:12px;">Some notes:
<ul>
    <li>This is my first attempt at data injestion and my codes could probably be much more efficient.</li>
    <li>The data injestion was designed to be connected to Google cloud. However, I am on the free tier so by the time this project is live, the free tier would have probably expired and I would have shut down the GCP server.</li>
    <li>The data injestion is only for 3 years as I had concerns about the storage limit of the GCP server to remain in the free tier.</li>
<ul>
